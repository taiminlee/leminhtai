# Crude Server 
Develop a book API with expressjs and typescript


## Getting Started

+ Node.js (version 18.18.2)
+ npm (version 9.8.1)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install dependency

### `npm db:seed`

Run the seeding database operation
> [!WARNING]
> It is necessary to first execute this script, this will generate the necessary mock data and table to work with API. 

### `npm start`

Start the development server. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

## Installing Thunder Client extension

To interact with API, I have included a pre-configure API collection `thunder-collection_books.json` for this project.

To use the API collection

1. Install the Thunder Client on VS Code.
2. In the Thunder Client view, click import
3. Choose the file `thunder-collection_books.json`
